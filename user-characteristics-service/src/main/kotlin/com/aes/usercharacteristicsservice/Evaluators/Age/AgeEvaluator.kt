/**
 *     Data Preprocessing:
 *         Clean and preprocess the text data by removing irrelevant characters, special symbols, and normalizing the text (e.g., converting to lowercase).
 *
 *     Feature Extraction:
 *         Extract relevant features from the text data. These can include word frequency, n-grams (sequences of adjacent words), and syntactic features.
 *
 *     Machine Learning Models:
 *         Train a machine learning model on a labeled dataset with user ages. Common models include Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests, or deep learning models like recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or transformers.
 *
 *     Word Embeddings:
 *         Use word embeddings like Word2Vec or GloVe to represent words in a continuous vector space. These embeddings can capture semantic relationships and improve the model's understanding of the text.
 *
 *     Age-Related Linguistic Patterns:
 *         Explore linguistic patterns that are associated with different age groups. Younger individuals might use certain slang, abbreviations, or trendy phrases, while older individuals may exhibit more formal language.
 *
 *     Social Media Analysis:
 *         If the data includes social media messages, analyze platform-specific language patterns. Different age groups may have distinct ways of expressing themselves on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram.
 *
 *     Ensemble Models:
 *         Consider using ensemble models that combine multiple models to improve overall accuracy.
 *
 *     Evaluate and Validate:
 *         Assess the model's performance using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Validate the model on a separate test dataset to ensure generalization.
