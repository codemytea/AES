/**
 *     Word Count:
 *         Calculate the average word count per message.
 *         Longer messages may suggest a more extensive vocabulary and possibly higher literacy.
 *
 *     Vocabulary Complexity:
 *         Create a list of common words (stop words) and calculate the percentage of non-stop words in each message.
 *         Higher percentage of non-stop words may indicate a more diverse vocabulary.
 *
 *     Spelling and Grammar:
 *         Use a spell-checking library to identify spelling mistakes.
 *         Count the number of grammatical errors (subject-verb agreement, tense issues, etc.).
 *         More errors might suggest lower literacy.
 *
 *     Sentence Structure:
 *         Analyze sentence length and complexity.
 *         Longer and more complex sentences might indicate a higher literacy level.
 *
 *     Punctuation:
 *         Count the usage of punctuation marks.
 *         Proper punctuation may be associated with better writing skills.
 *
 *     Readability Scores:
 *         Utilize readability scores like Flesch-Kincaid, Gunning Fog, or Coleman-Liau.
 *         Higher readability scores generally correlate with higher literacy.
 *
 *     Topic Modeling:
 *         Analyze the topics discussed in the messages.
 *         Sophisticated and varied topics may suggest a higher literacy level.
 *
 *     Machine Learning (Optional):
 *         Train a machine learning model using labeled data to predict literacy levels.
 *         Use features such as word frequency, syntactic complexity, and sentiment.
