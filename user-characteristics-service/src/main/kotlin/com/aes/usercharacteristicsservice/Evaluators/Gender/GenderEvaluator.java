/**
 *     Name Analysis:
 *         Extract names from the SMS messages and use a gender prediction tool based on names. Many languages have gender-specific names, but this is not foolproof, especially in multicultural datasets where names may not have clear gender associations.
 *
 *     Pronoun Analysis:
 *         Analyze the use of pronouns (he, she, they) in the text. However, this might not be reliable as people might not always use pronouns consistent with their gender identity.
 *
 *     Statistical Language Models:
 *         Train a machine learning model on a labeled dataset where the gender of users is known. Features can include word frequency, syntactic structures, and patterns associated with gendered language.
 *
 *     Emoji Analysis:
 *         Some studies have suggested that the use of certain emojis may be correlated with gender. However, this is a less reliable method and may not be applicable to all cultures.
 *
 *     Social Media Analysis:
 *         If the SMS messages are from social media or messaging platforms, explore platform-specific language patterns that may be associated with gender.
 *
 *     Multilingual Analysis:
 *         If your dataset includes multiple languages, consider using language-specific models for gender prediction. However, this would require language identification for each message.
 *
 *     Ensemble Models:
 *         Combine multiple features and models to create an ensemble that might improve accuracy.
